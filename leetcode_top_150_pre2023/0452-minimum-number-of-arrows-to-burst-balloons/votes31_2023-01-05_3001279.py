A balloon [1, 6] and a balloon [2, 9] can be replaced with one balloon [2, 6] because any arrow it this can burst both the balloons. Also we can check further balloons with this overlap as one balloon because 
- if it overlaps with this we can burst all 3 with 1 arrow so, we can store the overlap of all 3 as one balloon.
-  if it doesn\'t we were going to need 2 arrows for all three anyway so we can store that one ballon seperately.
